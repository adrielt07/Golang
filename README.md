# Golang

What is Go?
1. Compiled - code is efficiently adapted to the machine it's running on. It's no running on a VM or interpreted.
2. Garbage-collected - no need to manage memory. This is strange for a programming language that is compiled, which makes go 
3. Concurrent - ables to do more than one thing at a time
