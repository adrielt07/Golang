# Golang

## Purpose
This is just my personal notes. Trying to learn Go in 2 weeks :)

What is Go?
Go is a programming language created by Google engineers, Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson.

1. Compiled - code is efficiently adapted to the machine it's running on. It's no running on a VM or interpreted.
2. Garbage-collected - no need to manage memory. This is strange for a programming language that is compiled, which makes 'Go' unique compared to other compiled languages.
3. Concurrent - ables to do more than one thing at a time

### File and Directories
1. Introduction - basic functionality of Golang

2. Testing_with_Go - basic testing with Golang
